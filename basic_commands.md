# basic_git_commands

Basic Commands I am using 
- git log (to check what has been updated)
- git pull (to pull latest versuib from tracjed repo and override my local before starting work)
- git status (check local repo changes)
- git add 'file name'(add the file to staging - or add file for tracking)
- git commit -m "message here" (add an message at every commit)
- git push (push changes to the remore master)  
- git push origin master (you can push to branches as well)
- git remote show origin (To know where you current local file is tracking to which remore branch)

- git diff  (this "-" minus means what is in the repository "+" means what's added - little dif from unix)
- git diff --staged (check the dif only in the staged v.s repo. So repo is - minus, staged is + plus  )
