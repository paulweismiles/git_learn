This is important to remember

If I have a script touched - saved in local repo.

And on my working directory isn't clean

git status says - there is one file untracked 

e.g.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        js/mq-custom-2-libanswers.js

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

"Git pull" from remote master does not overrides the uncommitted - un tracked file.
namely - it will not be overridden 

Once it is git added, git pull will override (test this statement)
